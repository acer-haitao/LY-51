Traffic is a program that controls a traffic light.

The traffic light is timed and lets cars pass during a
specific time period.  There is a pedestrial crossing
button that lets pedestrians cross.  The lights are
connected to Port 1.  You can see this in action using
dScope.

There are several things of interest here:

*  This program uses RTX51 Tiny.  Program initialization
   and operation code are in TRAFFIC.C.  Look for the
   init task to see where everything starts.

*  Serial I/O is interrupt and signal driven.  Look at
   SERIAL.C for the complete, encapsulated module (you
   may want to use this in your programs).

The TRAFFIC program is available in one target:
  Simulator: Small Model:  TRAFFIC example in SMALL model 
                           for Simulation

The configuration file Conf_tny.A51 disables the round-robin timeout
and enables the CPU idle mode.
