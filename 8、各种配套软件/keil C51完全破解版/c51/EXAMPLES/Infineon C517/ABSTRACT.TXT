The SAMPL517 program uses the additional features of the C517,
C517A and C509 CPU to simulate a Hewlett Packard calculator.
The following calculator features are supported:

+        -        *        /
SIN      COS      TAN      SQRT
LOG      ASIN     ACOS     ATAN
EXP      LOG10


The following source files provide useful 517 routines.

*  GETKEY.C:  This file contains routines to get a char from
   the 517's second serial port.

*  PUTCHAR.C:  This file contains routines to output a char
   to the 517's second serial port.

Note that the second serial port is used in dScope by reassigning
the second serial port to the serial window.  Look at the assign
command.

The SAMPL517 program is configured for testing with the
µVision2 simulator.
