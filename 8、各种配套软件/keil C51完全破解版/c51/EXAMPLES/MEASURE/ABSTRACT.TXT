The MEASURE program uses the analog inputs of the C515 to
simulate a datalogger.  This example shows how you can use
signal functions in dScope to simulate a signal coming into
one of the analog inputs of the C515.

The MEASURE program is available in different targets:
  Simulator:   MEASURE example in SMALL model for Simulation
  Monitor51:   MEASURE example in SMALL model for the
               MCB517AC Eval Board
