LPC932 EXAMPLE:	USING THE EEPROM TO SAVE DATA DURING POWER OFF
Christian Kulig, 12/06/02

INTRODUCTION:
The EEPROM of the LPC932 is a nonvolatile memory for storing parameter or certain data.
The interface to the EEPROM consists of three SFRs which allow to write single bytes, 
fill rows (64 bytes), fill the whole block (512 bytes), and to read bytes.

DESCRIPTION:
This sample shows the usage of the three EEPROM SFRs for writing and reading bytes. 
The application is to count power cycles. That means, on every power on, a counter 
is incremented and displayed on the LED bar of the MCB900 board. Since on every 
power off or reset the RAM and all SFR are reset to default values, this counter 
must be saved to the EEPROM. On the occurrence of a power up or after a reset, the 
previous counter value is read from the EEPROM, incremented by one and written back 
to the EEPROM. Then the new valued is displayed on the LED bar connected to Port 2.
